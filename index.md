Welcome to the **Redis by Example** Tutorials. In this series I want to give an introduction
to Redis and its use cases, with some by real world examples.

This is an ongoing work. I will try to keep chapters and examples once every while,
and to keep the information up-to-date.

## Main Pages

### Basics

- [Introduction to Redis](introduction.html)
- [Redis as a Key-Value Store](key-value-store.html)
- [Strings](strings.html)
- [Expiring Keys](expiring-keys.html)

More chapters are coming

## Appendices

- [Installing Redis](installing-redis.html)
- [Installing Ruby and Sinatra](installing-ruby-and-sinatra.html)
