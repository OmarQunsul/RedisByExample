## What is Redis

Redis is a popular open source key/value, in-memory database, that has gained popularity in the last decade. 
This is mainly due to its simplicity, speed and support on the internet. 

## What I covering in these tutorials

In this series, I want to give brief tutorials
to several of the Redis commands, data structures and use cases. But I won't stop there, I will also try to open the curtains and 
so that we look at the internals of Redis itself, to see how it's working. I will try to show some snippets of the 
Redis project itself, and see what they mean. By the way, 
Redis is written in the C Programming Language.

Besides, I want to take an example driven approach to clarify the concepts, to explore 
how each component in Redis can be applied to solve real world problems. 

I will also cover some operational topics regarding Redis. For example, how to run Redis on your own 
Mac Laptop, Linux Server. How to automate the creation of Redis Instances using Terraform, and 
explore different managed hosting versions of Redis via Cloud Provider

Not only that, I will try to use different programming languages and frameworks 
to build our example projects. With that we will explore different ways to connect to Redis, also with 
different libraries. I hope you will have fun exploring different programming languages, like I 
do myself. So let's get started.
